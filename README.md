This code calculates the mathematical (and physical) constant e, which is roughly equal to 2.718281828459045. 
The program calculates this by adding up the inverse factorial of the first n integers, which you define at the beginning of the code run.
Even though it is the 'classic' way of defining e, found by Jacob Bernoulli, it isn't very effiecient. I've ran this code up to the first 8.500.000 integers, and it only got the first 7 digits correct.
For reference, the factorial way of defining it (check my other e-repository) can get up to 8 correct digits with an n-value of 10.

This code calculates the mathematical (and physical) constant e, which is roughly equal to 2.718281828459045. 
One program calculates this by adding 1 to the inverse of an n-value, and then raising it to the power of that number n (I'll call the given n-value a seed from now on).
Even though it is the 'classic' way of defining e, found by Jacob Bernoulli, it isn't very effiecient. After running this code up to the first 8.500.000 integers, it only got the first 7 digits correct.
For reference, the factorial way of defining it (check my other e-repository) can get up to 8 correct digits with a seed of 10.

This code calculates the mathematical (and physical) constant e, which is roughly equal to 2.718281828459045.
It calculates this by adding up the inverse of the factorial of the first n integers (starting from 0) (I'll call the given n-value a seed from now on). 
This way of calculating is many, many times more efficient than it's classic counterpart. 
For reference, the factorial way of defining it can get up to 8 correct digits with a seed of 10, but the classic way only got 7 correct digits with a seed of 8.500.000 (check my other e-program).
